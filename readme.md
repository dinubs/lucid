# Lucid

Lucid is a 2D Javascript game-engine, primarily for the platforming genre. Heavily based on the game-engine Dissimulate posted on both [GitHub](https://github.com/dissimulate/Clarity) and [CodePen](https://codepen.io/dissimulate/pen/CqIxk). It's quite evolved from that engine though, as things are much more broken apart now, and easier to extend onto.

There are a handful of [code examples](https://github.com/dinubs/lucid) and examples you can [play](https://lucid.dinubs.now.sh).
